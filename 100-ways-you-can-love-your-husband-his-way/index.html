		<p>Discuss this list with your husband. Ask him to check the ones most meaningful to him and then arrange them in order of importance to him. Use this list as a basis for learning his views. Your relationship can be greatly strengthened as you use these suggestions.<span id="more-28"></span></p>
<p>1. Communicate with him respectfully.<br />
2. Regard him as important and let him know he’s important to you.<br />
3. Purposefully try to understand his feelings—even when you disagree with him.<br />
4. Show interest in his friends giving him some time with them if they’re trust-worthy.<br />
5. Ask for his opinion and let him know you value what he says.<br />
6. Tell him you both love him AND like him.<br />
7. Let him feel your approval and affections.<br />
8. Protect his dignity on a daily basis.<br />
9. Be tender with him realizing he has feelings also.<br />
10. Foster an atmosphere of laughter in your home. Look for ways to laugh together.<br />
11. Avoid sudden major changes without discussion giving him time to adjust.<br />
12. When you go out on a date together don’t bring up problems—have fun instead.<br />
13. Focus on what he’s doing right, instead of focusing so often on the negatives.<br />
14. Show interest in what he feels is important in life.<br />
15. Correct him gently and in private.<br />
16. Recognize that the first few minutes after a spouse comes home often sets the stage for how the rest of the evening will go. So try to make the first few minutes of seeing him a positive experience. (And then ease into the negative if it’s necessary.)<br />
17. Make special time available to him apart from the children.<br />
18. Don’t allow any family member to treat him disrespectfully. Be the one to defend him to any family member that dishonors his place as your husband.<br />
19. Compliment him often.<br />
20. Be creative when you express your love, both in words and in actions.<br />
21. Talk with him about having specific family goals for each year to work on to achieve together so you will both feel closer to each other as a marital team.<br />
22. Don’t over commit yourself. Leave time for him.<br />
23. Extend God’s grace to him and be forgiving when he offends you.<br />
24. Find ways to show him you need him.<br />
25. Give him time to be alone. (This energizes him to reconnect at other times.)<br />
26. Admit your mistakes; don’t be afraid to be humble. Peel away your pride.<br />
27. Defend him to those who disrespectfully talk about him. Remember that love protects (1 Corinthians 13:7).<br />
28. Respect his desire to do well—not his performance.<br />
29. Rub his feet or neck, or scratch his back after a hard day.<br />
30. Take time for the two of you to sit and talk calmly (schedule it when necessary).<br />
31. Initiate going out on romantic outings (when he’s not tired).<br />
32. Email him when he’s at work, telling him how much you love him.<br />
33. Surprise him with a fun gift of some kind that he’d really enjoy.<br />
34. Express how much you appreciate him for working so hard to support the family.<br />
35. Tell him how proud you are of him for who he is (giving him specific reasons).<br />
36. Give advice in a loving way — not in a nagging or belittling way.<br />
37. Help your husband to be the Spiritual head at home (without “lording” it over him).<br />
38. Reserve some energy for him so you’re not so tired when he wants you sexually.<br />
39. Don’t expect him to do projects beyond his natural capabilities.<br />
40. Pray for him to enjoy God’s best in life.<br />
41. Take special notice for what he has done for you and the family.<br />
42. Brag about him to other people both in front of him and even when he’s not there.<br />
43. Share your feelings with him at appropriate times (but keep it brief when he’s tired—sometimes men can feel “flooded” by too many words).<br />
44. Tell him 3 things you specifically appreciate about him.<br />
45. Honor him in front of the children (differ respectfully in private when necessary).<br />
46. Give him time to unwind for a little while after he comes home from work. Arrange ahead of time to take your “time out”, giving him a few minutes with the children.<br />
47. Get up with him, even when he gets up earlier than you want to and pray with him. (Hopefully you can go back to sleep afterwards. If not, it’s a sacrifice worth making.)<br />
48. Be his “help-mate” in whatever ways you sense he needs it.<br />
49. Do some shoulder-to-shoulder activities with him (like watching a movie or taking a drive together) without talking. Sometimes men just like to BE with you and not talk.<br />
50. Be a student of his ways so you show your love in ways he best comprehends it.<br />
51. When your husband is in a bad mood give him time to recover. Don’t crowd him.<br />
52. Help him to finish his goals, hobbies, or education when your see he needs it.<br />
53. Treat him as if God has stamped on his forehead: “Handle With Care.”<br />
54. Work to get rid of habits that annoy him.<br />
55. Be kind and thoughtful to his relatives. Don’t make him choose between you.<br />
56. Don’t compare his relatives with yours in a negative way.<br />
57. Thank him for things he’s done around the house. (It means a lot to men).<br />
58. Don’t expect credit for all you do for him. Do it as “unto the Lord.”<br />
59. Make sure he agrees with everything important that you’re planning to do.<br />
60. Do little things for him—an unexpected kiss, coffee in bed, etc.<br />
61. Don’t belittle his intelligence or be cynical in your words with him.<br />
62. Initiate sex periodically. And respond more often.<br />
63. Sometimes let him enjoy his day off work without having to “work” at home.<br />
64. Get to the point in your discussions. Spare him details unless he wants them.<br />
65. Discover his sexual needs.<br />
66. Surprise him with a 15 second kiss when he gets home from work.<br />
67. Wink at him from across the room when you’re out at a group function.<br />
68. Give him the benefit of the doubt when he mis-speaks.<br />
69. Don’t quarrel over words.<br />
70. Be kind and courteous with him. (Don’t be kinder to strangers than to him.)<br />
71. When things go wrong, instead of assessing blame, focus on how to do better.<br />
72. As a kindness, don’t say, “I told you so.”<br />
73. Try not to argue over money. Peacefully discuss future expenditures instead.<br />
74. Take him out on dates—pre-planning all of the details ahead of time.<br />
75. Hold his hand and snuggle up close to him at times both at home and in public.<br />
76. Praise his good decisions; minimize the bad ones.<br />
77. Tell him you love him more often.<br />
78. Put love notes in his pockets and brief case.<br />
79. Sit with him while he’s watching TV—even if the program doesn’t interest you.<br />
80. Don’t expect him to read your mind. (Family’s are spared grief when a husband isn’t required to read their wife’s mind despite the fact that the wife thinks he should.)<br />
81. Periodically, give him time with his family alone.<br />
82. Check with him before you throw away his papers and stuff. (He may view them as more important than you realize.)<br />
83. Work to keep yourself in shape in every way.<br />
84. Let him express himself freely, without fear of being called stupid or illogical.<br />
85. Carefully choose your words. Remember to “speak the truth in LOVE.”<br />
86. Don’t criticize him in front of others—keeping his dignity in tact.<br />
87. Visit his childhood home with him.<br />
88. When you’re angry, express it in respectful ways. Don’t give the silent treatment.<br />
89. Pray for him.<br />
90. Make him homemade soup when he’s sick.<br />
91. Look your best—dress to honor him and make him proud to be seen with you.<br />
92. Support him when someone tries to put him down. Be his best cheer leader.<br />
93. Don’t disagree with him in front of the children.<br />
94. Take him for a weekend get-away without the children.<br />
95. Cheer his successes whether in business or in other areas of everyday living.<br />
96. Graciously teach him how to demonstrate his love for you.<br />
97. Give him coupons to redeem—maybe for a back scratch or a shoulder rub.<br />
98. Buy him a gift certificate to his favorite lunch spot and put it in his wallet.<br />
99. Hide notes for him around the house where only he will find them.<br />
100. Thank him for just being himself.</p>
